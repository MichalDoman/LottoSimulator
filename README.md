# LottoSimulator (workshop exercise)

This is a terminal app, in which a user can try to guess 6, randomly generated numbers in range from 1 to 49, just like in real lotto. The range, however, can be adjusted. The program begins with the user
having to input 6 chosen numbers (6 by default). After the inputs are given and
validated, in the console it is shown what numbers were chosen, what were generated by computer, how many guesses were
correct, and if there were any correct guesses, the app shows which numbers were correct. Below there are example
console outputs:

```
Your numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Winning numbers: [3, 5, 14, 24, 25, 36]
Correct guesses: [3, 5]

Congratulations! You guessed 2 numbers!
```
```
6: Choose a number from 1 to 49: 67
This is not a valid entry!

6: Choose a number from 1 to 49: 1

Your numbers: [1, 12, 13, 23, 34, 36]
Winning numbers: [15, 26, 30, 37, 43, 48]
Correct guesses: []

Unfortunately, you did not guess any of the numbers :(
